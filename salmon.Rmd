### Summary: US atlantic salmon imports from `r params$import_country`

Data: US Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. *Aquaculture data: Aquaculture Trade - All years and all countries.* 2019. https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/aquaculture-data.aspx

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

# Note: Allison already cleaned up salmon data raw & kept the four countries with top total imports in total for the years reported (Chile, Canada, Norway, United Kingdom). These exist in `salmon_clean.csv`.
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
salmon_imports <- read_csv("salmon_clean.csv")

country_data <- salmon_imports %>% 
  filter(Country == params$import_country)

ggplot(data = country_data, aes(x = year, y = imported)) +
  geom_line()

# Try it out! Run in Console:
# rmarkdown::render(input = "salmon.Rmd", params = list(import_country = "Country Name"), output_file = "output_file_name.html")

# Then, try rendering with the render_salmon_report() function (you need to have run the code in render_functions.R to make the function available in your working session)!

# THEN, try running a for loop that contains that function to auto-render reports for all of the countries. Yay automation!
