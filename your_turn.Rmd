### Your job: create a parameterized report using data from `penguins.csv`. 

- Your report should contain a ggplot graph of flipper length versus body mass for the **species** that you choose.

- Create a function that will render the report for the species you pick, saved as an .html with format 'penguin_report_SPECIESNAME.html'. 

- Create a function that will automatically render a separate report for *all species* in the data. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
